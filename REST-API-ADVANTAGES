First of all, I apologize in choosing github as the source of writing technical and descriptive topic

REST API : REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is very simple and its over HTTP which makes it more simpler. 
(More about REST Apis can be found on http://rest.elkstein.org/ and http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/whatisrest.html)

This article is more focussed on the application advantages of using the REST API:
1. I was designing the Mobile App in iOS for Broadcasting emergency alerts targetting university students. It required the server and 
the database. Since I was working on a small scale project, I could not afford to invest time in setting up the server, 
installing the db and using the SQL queries to fetch the data from the DB. This time was saved with the help of REST APIs.
There are very powerful database servers available online( example - https://cloud-us.clusterpoint.com). I used these database servers 
to eliminate the need of setting the server and installing the DB. Now what about fetching this data or adding the data
or deleting this data. At this point of time, REST can play a very important role by exposing APIs over HTTP to fetch, insert, delete 
and update the data in the database. So all I had to do was just fire a HTTP request with appropriate method over the url and I was able 
to perform all the database operations (Refer : https://www.clusterpoint.com/docs/?page=13-Retrieve&language=REST&version=3).
